## Installation

You must have installed [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "**Node.js**") on your machine.

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/faaziahamed/sydpro-test
# Go to server folder
$ cd server
# Install server dependencies
$ npm install
# Run node api server - http://localhost:8000
$ npm run dev
# Go to frontend folder
$ cd frontend
# Install frontend dependencies
$ npm install
# Run frontend
$ npm run serve
```

Now we have the front-end running on port 3000 and the Node REST API on port 8000.

## How it works

In this project, the front-end and back-end were developed separately, thereby both of them will run on different ports.
